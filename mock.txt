"input": "how to to restart your career as a woman after marriage"
"output":
"Restarting your career after marriage — especially as a woman — can feel overwhelming, but it's very doable with the right steps.
Here’s a clear path you can follow:

1. Reflect on What You Want Now
Interests change over time. Ask yourself:

"What do I enjoy now?"
"What lifestyle do I want?"
"Do I want a flexible job, a remote role, or am I ready for full-time office work?"

Think about industries you genuinely like (tech, marketing, education, healthcare, fashion, etc.).

2. Assess Your Skills
List what skills you already have (communication, writing, coding, management, etc.).

Identify what skills are missing for the roles you want. (If needed, plan to upskill with online courses, certifications, or short workshops.)

3. Build a Fresh Resume and LinkedIn
Highlight transferable skills (teamwork, leadership, problem-solving, etc.).

You can mention a "career break" confidently and explain it simply:

"Career break to focus on family responsibilities, now ready to return with renewed energy and focus."

4. Start Small to Build Confidence
Freelancing, internships, part-time jobs, consulting — these are great starting points.

If you’re worried about gaps or rusty skills, this builds real recent experience without overwhelming pressure.

5. Network, Network, Network
Reach out to old colleagues, college friends, family friends.
Just let them know you're looking — you’d be surprised how often opportunities come through personal networks.

Attend local events, online webinars, workshops in your field.

6. Consider Women-Focused Platforms
Some companies and platforms specialize in helping women restart careers (e.g.,

JobsForHer (India),

HerSecondInnings (India),

Path Forward (global),

Women Back to Work).

7. Practice Interviewing
Prepare to confidently explain your career break.
It's not a weakness — it's just part of your journey.

8. Stay Kind to Yourself
Imposter syndrome is very common when restarting.
Remember: You’re not starting from scratch; you're starting from experience.

Would you like me to also suggest a few career ideas depending on your background and current interests? 🌟
(Example: remote jobs, creative fields, high-paying jobs, flexible ones, etc.)"
